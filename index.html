    <img src="ceo.jpg" alt="John Agbeja" style="width:100%; max-width:300px; border-radius:10px; margin-bottom:1rem;">
    <p>John Agbeja is a visionary entrepreneur, digital creator, and the founder of JohnAgbeja Beanova—a brand born from a passion to preserve African food heritage while embracing modern standards.</p>
    <p>Growing up in Nigeria, John witnessed the value of traditional foods like iru (locust beans) in both nourishment and culture. But he also saw a gap—how something so cherished could be packaged and presented in a cleaner, more accessible way.</p>
    <p>JohnAgbeja Beanova was inspired by a deep craving to elevate his late mother’s legacy. She was a dedicated locust beans seller whose resilience and commitment to quality left a lasting impression on her son. Her passing became the seed that grew into a brand—honoring her trade, her dreams, and the values she lived by.</p>
    <p>With a background in content creation and a heart for community empowerment, John launched Beanova to provide hygienic, preservative-free locust beans that fit into today’s kitchens—both locally and globally.</p>
    <p>More than just a business owner, John is building a movement—bringing dignity to local food processing, empowering resellers, and inspiring young Africans to think bigger with what they have in their hands.</p>

  <h3 onclick="toggleSection('aboutus')">About Us</h3>
  <div id="aboutus" class="hidden">
<h2>The Name Behind the Brand</h2>
<p>"JohnAgbeja" reflects the founder’s identity and personal commitment, while "Beanova" is a fusion of Beans and Innovation—capturing our mission to reimagine and modernize the traditional African locust beans for today’s world.</p>
    <p>At JohnAgbeja Beanova, we believe that food is more than fuel—it’s a storyteller. And one of the richest stories from our land is told through iru (locust beans)—a cherished African ingredient steeped in tradition, flavor, and identity.</p>
    <p>Born in Nigeria and deeply rooted in local culture, Beanova was founded to solve a real problem: how to preserve the authenticity of locust beans while meeting modern standards of hygiene, convenience, and presentation. We saw the need to bridge the gap between heritage and innovation—and we stepped in.</p>
    <p>But our story runs deeper. Beanova is also a tribute to the legacy of John Agbeja’s late mother, a passionate locust beans seller who served her community with resilience, dignity, and love. Her dedication inspired a vision—to take what she started and elevate it to national and global relevance.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Preservative-free</li>
      <li>Hygienically processed and packaged</li>
      <li>Naturally fermented with care</li>
      <li>Accessible to all—from market women to health-conscious families and export buyers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We’re not just in the business of selling food—we’re on a mission to transform the face of indigenous African ingredients, rebranding them for today’s consumers and preparing them for global shelves.</p>
    <p>Beanova is where tradition meets transformation—one scoop of locust beans at a time.</p>
